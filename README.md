Notes on other patchers
-----------------------
- As far as we know this is the most comphrensive patcher that exists
- LineageOS is most likely developing an equally comphrensive patcher, it most likely will not be licensed GPL, and might not even end up being open source
- Our Linux CVE repository is currently the most comphrensive patch database, with many hundreds more then that of others
- Our goal is not to compete, but to patch. This is a huge problem that as a community we need to solve!
